# E-Collecting Hackathon
At the Federal Chancellery's [E-Collecting](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting.html) [Hackathon](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/aktuelles.html) (October 31 and November 1, 2025, in Bern), we are designing and developing solutions for collecting electronic signatures for popular initiatives and referendums from A to Z. Meet developers, experts, and interested parties from government, politics, academia, and civil society, and play an active role in shaping e-collecting. Our team from the Bern University of Applied Sciences has been charged with running the hackathon. [Register now!](https://findmind.ch/c/hackathon-registration)

Over the course of two days, you will develop your solutions, addressing the **9 (?)** topics outlined in the white paper **(add link to updated version)**. You will work in teams taking different approaches to said topics. You can develop a conceptual, clickable, and/or technical prototype. Either way, you should clearly present the interactions and data flows between actors, software, and infrastructure components over time, as well as the user experience of these actors.

Together, you will contribute to comparing different ways of how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. As part of the [participatory process](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/partizipativer_prozess.html), your solutions will be discussed in subsequent workshops and will ultimately be taken into account for the official decision on which option to pursue as a pilot. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated.
